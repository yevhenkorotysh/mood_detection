    <h1>Mood Detection Service from Audio Files</h1>

    <p>This project is aimed at building a Mood Detection Service from audio files. The goal is to create two services:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Service to Store an Audio File:</strong> This service allows users to upload an audio file, which is then stored in a cloud storage system, like Azure Blob Store.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Service to Retrieve Mood:</strong> The second service analyzes the uploaded audio file to determine the mood and returns one of three different moods: Happy, Sad, or Calm. The actual mood determination is not implemented in this project; instead, a random mood generator is used based on the time of the day.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>

    <h3>Language Choice</h3>
    <p>The service code can be implemented in the language of your choice, although Python is preferred due to its extensive libraries and ease of use for audio processing. In this example, we will use Python for illustration purposes.</p>

    <h3>Components</h3>
    <p>The architecture of the project involves several components:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Audio File Storage:</strong> Cloud storage, such as Azure Blob Store, is used to store uploaded audio files. These files should be limited to a maximum duration of 30 seconds and can be in WAV or MP3 format.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Audio Processing:</strong> To analyze the mood, the uploaded audio file is processed. In this example, a random mood is generated based on the time of the day. However, a real implementation would require audio analysis using libraries like Librosa or PyDub for feature extraction.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Store:</strong> You may need a database to keep track of the uploaded audio files, their metadata, and the associated moods. A database design that suits your needs should be chosen.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Developer Console Testing:</strong> Both services can be tested from the developer console without the need to create a public API. Testing instructions should be provided in the project documentation.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cloud Services</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Azure Blob Store:</strong> Azure Blob Storage is used to store the audio files securely and efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Database:</strong> The database can be hosted on a cloud service like Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) or Azure SQL Database, depending on your cloud provider.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Deployment</h3>
    <p>This project is deployed on AWS. You can test it by following this link: <a href="http://mdvenv.eba-9xpeamqy.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/">Mood Detection Service</a>.</p>

    <h3>Project Structure</h3>
    <p>The application design and code structure can be found in the <a href="link_to_design_document">Application Design Document</a>. This document explains the architecture, data flow, and components of the application.</p>

    <h3>Testing</h3>
    <p>Unit tests and integration tests for the service code should be provided in the project's <code>tests</code> directory. These tests help ensure the reliability and correctness of the code.</p>

    <h3>Improvements</h3>
    <p>For potential improvements, consider:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Implementing a real mood analysis algorithm.</li>
        <li>Enhancing the user interface for better user experience.</li>
        <li>Adding support for more audio formats.</li>
        <li>Implementing user authentication and authorization for secure file uploads.</li>
    </ul>
